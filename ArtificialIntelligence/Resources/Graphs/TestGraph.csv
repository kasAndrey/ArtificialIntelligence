# First line contains N vertex names
# Next N lines represent coordinates of each vertex, respectively
# Next N lines consist of N edge weights (first line declares all weighted edges from it to other vertices, including itself)
# Valid weight can be only a positive number, every other symbol is considered no path (infinity)
# Comments and empty lines are being ignored
